This script is a bootstrap for a development environment, which installs and configures basic resources, such as tools and a ZSH shell setup, with essential add-ons.
For macOS for now. Soon I will make the adjustments to work on Linux.

### Basic Installation

Dev-setup is installed by running othe following commands in your terminal.

`bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/524c/dev-setup/main/install.sh)"`
